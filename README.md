I'm Bill, I'm not interested in anything. I got interested in coding from playing Minecraft once with my brother, 
wanted to add some mods and create servers. Very fun! I would like to learn about hacking into systems as well as 
creating hacks that be used in games. No hobbies/interests, I don't do much in my free tiem No website. I would
like to at least learn the basics of coding. Learn more complex things in future years. A robot that shoots disks.
